# Simulation-of-Electron-Trajectory-in-2D.
The Simulation of Electron Trajectory in 2D using Monte Carlo Simulation Method. The angle of collision is denoted by phi and the distance from the source to next point of collision is the lambda. A random value of "a" is selected twice for phi and lambda for the Simulation.
